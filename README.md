## Introduction
In the rapidly developing world, energy needs are increasing at the same pace. Since the industrial revolution, countries with access to energy resources have come to economically strong positions. On the other hand, the ever-increasing macro-economic and micro-economic competition between different entities is forcing the absolute need for efficient energy use in order to achieve economic efficacy and/or efficiency.

On the other hand, the global sustainable growth need has brought new opportunities and challenges hand-in-hand. Regulatory bodies have been forcing economic entities to use green energy sources more than non-green ones. Additionally, economic entities are encouraged to use green energy sources more efficiently.
Electricity, being relatively easy to transmit, has had ever-increasing use globally. Switching the electricity production mainly from non-green to green processes increases its potential for sustainability-oriented development. On the other hand, the relative inefficiency and higher cost of storing electrical energy make the instant balancing of demand and supply extremely important. 

For some product or service categories, deciding whether supply follows demand or demand follows supply can be regarded as a chicken-egg problem of economics. However, supply follows demand due to the need for instant balancing in the electricity market. Hence, for both producers and regulators, it is of utmost importance to have an excellent understanding of demand. An accurate demand forecast satisfies this need.

Electricity demand forecasting can be beneficial in different time horizons. For example, for an economic entity considering its existence in the long-term, a demand forecast with monthly or yearly resolution would be the most appropriate. In addition, for a producer trying to make operational adjustments in the near future, forecasting the daily demand for the upcoming week or fortnight would be beneficial.

On the other hand, an electricity producer who has to give hourly offers on the supply side in the Day-Ahead Market is primarily interested in the hourly forecasts for the next 24 hours. Similar models (if not the same) can be utilized for applications in these different time horizons with training with appropriate data.

Spot markets are divided into two; Day-Ahead Market (DAM) and Intra-Day Market (IDM). The DAM is the market where the electricity price for each hour of the next day is determined by auction and has a larger transaction volume. On the other hand, IDM enables the participants to change their position in the Day-Ahead Market for a certain amount of time before electricity is physically transmitted. Any imbalance in the electricity grid caused by a mismatch of demand and supply is compensated after the closure of the IDM. Hence, having precise demand forecasts will provide high value to all parties in the electricity market.

This project proposes an algorithm and implementation for forecasting hourly demand in the next 24-hour time frame. The forecasting system can be utilized by market players on the supply side and the regulatory bodies most interested in balancing the supply and demand. The system is trained and tested on Turkish electricity market data and hence, very few features are special to Turkey. Nevertheless the system can be utilized in any electricity market with minimal modifications (and re-training).
