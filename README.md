# Electricity Demand Forecasting

In the rapidly developing world, energy needs are increasing at the same pace. Since the industrial revolution, countries with access to energy resources have come to economically strong positions. On the other hand, the ever-increasing macro-economic and micro-economic competition between different entities is forcing the absolute need for efficient energy use in order to achieve economic efficacy and/or efficiency.

On the other hand, the global sustainable growth need has brought new opportunities and challenges hand-in-hand. Regulatory bodies have been forcing economic entities to use green energy sources more than non-green ones. Additionally, economic entities are encouraged to use green energy sources more efficiently.
Electricity, being relatively easy to transmit, has had ever-increasing use globally. Switching the electricity production mainly from non-green to green processes increases its potential for sustainability-oriented development. On the other hand, the relative inefficiency and higher cost of storing electrical energy make the instant balancing of demand and supply extremely important. 

For some product or service categories, deciding whether supply follows demand or demand follows supply can be regarded as a chicken-egg problem of economics. However, supply follows demand due to the need for instant balancing in the electricity market. Hence, for both producers and regulators, it is of utmost importance to have an excellent understanding of demand. An accurate demand forecast satisfies this need.
